How To Use:

1. Put all the Exam Papers Files in one folder. Accepted files are: [Text File(*.txt) -  Ms Word Files (*.doc , *.docx)].
2. Remove any irrelavent pages/data from the files as much as possible (e.g. remove the introduction page which contains the name of subject, examiners and/or instructions..etc).
3. Run the application, browse and select your folder.
4. Choose the appropriate flexibility.
5. Hit start button and wait until it finishes parsing.
6. When the program finishes, a dialog will pop up to save the result in a *.txt file.


Regarding the Flexibility:
The rule of thumb is: 
	- More Flexibility means more sensitivity to similarity but less specificity : More dumb data in the result but low chance not to miss any duplicate [at 100% flexibility will be no miss of duplicate questions but full of dumb data].
	- Less Flexibility means less sensitivity to similarity but more specificity : No dumb data in the result but a variable chance to miss a duplicate [at 1% flexibility will miss almost all duplicate questions but no dumb data].

It is up tp the user to choose the best flexibility because the appropriate value differes between the exam papers.
However, the recommended flexibility to "try" is: 25 - 50 - 75.
